                    <p>In the past, a young Madeleine Swann witnesses the murder of her mother by Lyutsifer Safin in a failed attempt to murder her father Mr. White. Madeleine shoots Safin, but he survives. She flees onto a nearby frozen lake and falls through the ice, but he rescues her.<br><br>
                        In the present, after the capture of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Madeleine is in Matera with James Bond. Spectre assassins ambush Bond when he visits Vesper Lynd's tomb. Though Bond and Madeleine escape the assassins led by Primo, he believes she has betrayed him, despite her pleas, and forces her to board a train out of Matera, leaving her.<br><br>
                        Five years later, the MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev is kidnapped from an MI6 laboratory. With M's approval Obruchev had developed Project Heracles, a bioweapon containing nanobots that infect like a virus upon touch and are coded to an individual's DNA, rendering it lethal to the target and their relatives but harmless to others. Bond has retired to Jamaica, where he is contacted by the CIA agent Felix Leiter and his colleague Logan Ash, who ask for Bond's help in finding Obruchev. Bond initially declines, but after Nomi, an MI6 agent and his successor as 007, tells him about Project Heracles, Bond agrees to help Leiter, over Nomi's warnings not to interfere.<br><br>
                        Bond goes to Cuba and meets Paloma, a CIA agent working with Leiter. They infiltrate a Spectre meeting for Blofeld's birthday to retrieve Obruchev. Still imprisoned in Belmarsh, Blofeld uses a disembodied "bionic eye" to lead the meeting and order his members to kill Bond with a "nanobot mist", but it kills all the Spectre members instead, as Obruchev had reprogrammed the nanobots to infect them on Safin's orders. Bond captures Obruchev and rendezvouses with Leiter and Ash, but Ash, a double agent working for Safin, kills Leiter and escapes with Obruchev.</p>

                    <p>Moneypenny and Q arrange a meeting between Bond and Blofeld in prison to try to find Obruchev. Safin visits and coerces Madeleine to infect herself with a nanobot dose to kill Blofeld, as she has been in contact with him since his imprisonment. When Bond encounters Madeleine at Blofeld's prison cell, he touches her and unknowingly infects himself before she leaves. Blofeld confesses to Bond that he staged the ambush at Vesper's tomb to appear as if Madeleine had betrayed him. Bond reacts by attacking Blofeld, unintentionally causing the nanobots to infect and kill him.<br><br>
                        Bond tracks Madeleine to her childhood home in Norway and learns she has a five-year-old daughter, Mathilde, who Madeleine claims is not his. Madeleine tells him that when Safin was a boy, his parents were murdered by her father on Blofeld's orders. Having avenged them by Blofeld being killed and destroying Spectre, Safin continues his rampage with Ash and their entourage in pursuit of Bond, Madeleine and Mathilde. Though Bond kills Ash and his thugs, Safin captures Madeleine and Mathilde.<br><br>
                        Q enables Bond and Nomi to infiltrate Safin's headquarters in a missile base, converted to a nanobot factory, on an island between Japan and Russia, where Obruchev is mass-producing the Heracles technology so Safin can use it to kill millions of people. Bond kills many of Safin's men while Nomi kills Obruchev by pushing him into a nanobot vat. Madeleine escapes captivity while Safin releases Mathilde. Nomi takes Madeleine and Mathilde away from the island; Bond stays to open the island's blast-resistant silo doors. He calls in a missile strike from HMS Dragon to destroy the factory, then kills Safin's remaining men, including Primo.<br><br>
                        Safin ambushes Bond, shooting him several times and infecting him with a vial containing nanobots programmed to kill Madeleine and Mathilde. Despite his injuries, Bond kills Safin after a fight and opens the silos. Speaking by radio with Madeleine, Bond tells her he loves her and encourages her to move on without him. Madeleine confirms that Mathilde is his daughter as Bond says goodbye. Missiles hit the island, destroying the nanobot factory and killing Bond.<br><br>
                        At MI6, M, Moneypenny, Nomi, Q and Tanner drink in Bond's memory. As Madeleine takes Mathilde to Matera, she tells her about her father, James Bond.</p>
